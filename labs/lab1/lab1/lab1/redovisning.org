* FRÃ…GA 1: Conceptual Understanding
** What is the primary purpose of pthread_create()?
*** c

* 2. Code Interpretation:
** How many threads, including the main thread, are running in the program?
*** c

* 3. Execution Sequence:
** Which of the following best describes the order of thread completion in the program?
*** a (if you use join)

* 4. Function Purpose:
** What is the role of pthread_join() in the code?
*** a

* 5. Thread Termination:
** In the printHello function, what does pthread_exit(NULL) do?
*** c

* Mini exercies:
** 4 CPU's, 
** Max Freq: 1.479 Ghz, 
** ModelName: Cortex-A57
** Architecture: aarch64
** Byte order: Little Endian
** Cache:
*** L1d (data)        cache:  32K
*** L1i (instruction) cache:  48K
*** L2 cache:            2048K

* Exercies A:
**         std        vec
** 00    1.553885  0.769244
** 01    0.685630  0.200093
** 02    0.534283  0.203975
** 03    0.497139  0.178087

*** Note: largest jump in performance is between 00 and 01
***       otherwise the improvement is negligable

* Exercies B:
** TODO: Redovisningen

* Exercies 3:
** Question: How many threads should you optimally launch? Why?
*** 4 Threads. One for each core. Also, each vector consists of 128 bits, 32 bit per paralized subset

** Question: Do you get the speed-up you expected? If not, why?
*** Yes.., little more than double.
